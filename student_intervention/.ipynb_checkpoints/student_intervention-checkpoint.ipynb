    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "- Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### DECISION TREES:\n",
    "- General applications:\n",
    "    - Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression problems, by creating a series of simple rules that can be visualized as a tree. We saw one possible use a few exercises ago, when we were predicting the probability of a given person of surviving the Titanic. \n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "    - Decision trees are easy to visualize and interpret.\n",
    "    - Require little data preparation, since it can handle datasets that have errors or missing values.\n",
    "    - Decision trees are able to handle both numerical and categorical data. \n",
    "    - The cost of running a tree is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: \n",
    "    - Trees can create complex hypothesis that do not generalize well (overfit). In the examples below, we can see that all the F1 score for the train data is always 1. \n",
    "    - Decision trees can be unstable: new information or features could result in very different tree and predictions.\n",
    "    - It’s possible to create biased trees if some classes dominate. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "###### SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES:\n",
    "- General applications:\n",
    "    - Support vector machines can be used for classification, regression, and outlier detection. SVMs have been used in text categorization, image recognition, character recognition, etc. \n",
    "- Strengths: \n",
    "    - Though the use of the kernel trick, SVMs are effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "    - SVMs are versatile since they enable the use of different kernels. \n",
    "    - SVMs are useful in cases where the number of features is greater than the number of samples. \n",
    "    - SVMs only use a subset of training points in the decision function (maximizing the margin), making it memory efficient. \n",
    "- Weaknesses:\n",
    "    - Because it requires de use of quadratic programming in large-scales tasks, SMSs can have a high algorithmic complexity and extensive memory requirements. \n",
    "    - SVMs will give poor performance if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples. \n",
    "    - SMVs do not directly provide probability estimates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "###### NAIVE BAYES:\n",
    "- General applications:\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on the assumption of independence between features. Naive Bayes has been used in document classification (for example, if a text belongs to sports, political, entertainment category, etc.), spam filtering, and medical diagnosis, among other.  \n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "    - Require small amount of training data to produce a prediction. \n",
    "    - Can be extremely fast compared to other, more sophisticated methods. \n",
    "    - Enables each distribution to be estimated independently, helping to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. \n",
    "- Weaknesses:\n",
    "    - Even when it's considered as a good classifier, its probability estimates are not completely accurate. \n",
    "    - By default Naive Bayes assumes independence between features, something that may not be entirely true. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Given what I know about the data (31 features and 395 observations), and the fact that it's a classification problem, I believe that the models mentioned above are appropriate. \n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
